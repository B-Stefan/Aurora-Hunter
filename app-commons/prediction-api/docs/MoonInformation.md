**azimuth** | **Double** | moon azimuth in radians (direction along the horizon, measured from south to west), e.g. 0 is south and Math.PI * 3/4 is northwest | 
**fraction** | **Double** | illuminated fraction of the moon; varies from 0.0 (new moon) to 1.0 (full moon)  | 
**phase** | **Double** | moon phase; varies from 0.0 to 1.0, described below (0.25 = quarter; 0.5 half moon .... ) |
